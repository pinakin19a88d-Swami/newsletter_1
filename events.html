					<h3>"Coming together is<br/> a beginning. Keeping<br/> together is progress.<br/> Working together is<br/> success - Henry Ford"</h3>
						<p>
							I'm sure we all can relate this quote by Henry Ford to the recent cricket tournament at Fleetguard - 'The Fleetguard Filters Premier League'
						</p>

						<p>
							15 teams, 195 players, 13 qualifying matches and 33 league matches. All of us coming together; with a lot of excitement and enthusiasm! The first goal was to qualify in the initial matches and get an opportunity to play at the PYC cricket ground in a blazing light. Floodlit matches were one of the main attractions of this year's Fleetguard Filtrum Premier League, as were the people coming from all over India to join the tournament.
						</p>

						<p>
						What a season, a true exhibition of everybody joining hands together and working towards one goal - "The winner's trophy". Only one team who would exhibit a true team spirit and play their best as team would be lifting the trophy. 
							
						</p>
							
						

					</div>

					<div class="para">
						<p>
							It was not as easy as it sounds. The catch in this year's tournament was that, the teams were randomly formed irrespective of location and department as it used to be earlier. Some of us knew each other well, while some were new to one another. Unknown faces and unaware of each others personal and playing skills, every team was suppose to decide on their own captains and the playing side.
						</p>

						<p>
							We were gauging each other, getting along, managing our fellow team mates and taking decisions. We all became a team in its true sense by the end of season. I'm sure we've found new friends and we understand each other better now.
							
						</p>

						<p>
							The team play helps us be a more understanding individual, open to listening to our fellow mates. So, it's not an overstatement when we can say that 'Cricket' was a Fleetguard's way of reaching to us with the message of team work and I am sure we all have understood it well! 
						</p>

						<p>
							I'm sure that we meet in the next year with same enthusiasm but with a better understanding and expectations of ourselves!
						</p>
