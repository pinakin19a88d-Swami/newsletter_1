					<p>
						Hello everyone!
					</p>

					<p>
						It once again gives me the pleasure to talk to all of you. As you are aware that we have our yearly communication, though we as an organization feel that this yearly communication is not enough. What is the reason that this communication is not enough because of the size of our company, the locations of our factories like Hosur, Nandur, Jamshedpur, Uttranchal. These are the four locations. Then there are our Area Growth Professionals in the After market who are may be in hundreds. Its rather impossible to connect everyday and at the same time having a yearly communication we feel is not enough. So, in such a scenario what is the best way to connect? How do we use the technology to connect?
					</p>

					<p>
						Therefore we thought about this initiative, which is known as a e newsletter or e communication whatever term you want to use. But the basic idea is through this technology, through these e mails through this e newsletter or communication, we would like to communicate to you on a quarterly basis as to what is happening around us. Now if you see this scenario what do we want to really communicate to all of you. Very simple things, the market is very dynamic it is changing really fast. Lot of OEMs are coming in, which are the new OEMs that are coming in, what is happening with the competition. The political situation, the environment, the improvement that is happening in say Nandur, whether it is copiable in Jamshedpur. Do people really know what is happening in Jamshedpur. Do people really know what is happeing in Hosur? That is what we want to communicate. And this is the easiest and fastest way to communicate is what we thought.
					</p>

					<p>
						You are also aware, that for the last three years we have been having our cricket tournaments, we are having Corporate Social Responsibility going on and we have lot of other activities like R.D. Burman night we had. So, these are all social events that are going on. Lot of times lot of things are not communicated. Lot of times we miss it. So that is also now we will include in this initiative which this is the first episode of this communication, and every quarter myself or Mr. Pandit or somebody senior from the management of the organization will be speaking to you. That is the whole intent of this communication, this e communication.
					</p>

					<p>
						So, this is the beginning of an initiative. Now, of course I would personally love to have a dialogue with each and every one of you. Though this is a monologue I am speaking you are listening but there is something called as a e mail where we have already created an id where you can send your suggestions as to how this particular communication can be improved and what are the necessary things that we should be doing in order to improve this communication.
					</p>

					<p>
						Thank You!
