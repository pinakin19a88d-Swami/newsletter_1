					<h6 class="maroonText"><span>Chairman</span> speaks about the vision for <span>FSPL</span> &amp; the path to achieve it.</h6>

					<p>
						Dear all,<br/><br/>This is my second opportunity to talk to you after a time of about six to eight months. I addressed all of you about a wonderful grand dream I am putting for our company. My dream is can we move our company up to a sales of three billion dollars from current level of 850 Crore rupees. A twenty times jump in a short period of time. As I explained to all of you that we can embrace this vision only because of our past experience of TOC where we could really gallop with a phenomenal speed and that gives me the confidence of embracing a bigger vision which is 3 billion dollar plus in sales.

					</p>

					<p>
						Now, when we want to go to t his, I told you that this vision is nothing but like the story of creation from big bang and which is not according to me impossible. However it will require some basic things to be looked at and I would like to just recap those so that we will all start sailing in that direction. The first thing is everybody must have this vision at least once a day in his mind will be my first request. So everybody should think of our company being a three billion dollar company in near future. That thought has to generate in everybody's mind because that is how the vision will start getting constructed.
					</p>

					<p>
						The second important point is that this vision is a big one, it is like a tall building having big foundation or a big tree having deep roots. So we will need to do a lot of work on the basics or on the foundations.
					</p>

					<p>
						So, what are the things that we said? One thing is we should have a culture of win-win or we call it inclusiveness. Inclusiveness or win-win culture we can not have it only in the factory or only in the house, it should be 24 by 7 culture in our life. The second thing what we talked was egoistic behaviour is a big obstacle so we need to remove it and continuously work on it. I gave you the example that ego means we should drop our position and everything once we go home and live as living being. If we practise that then ego will not come in our way in making this three billion a reality. The third thing is we always talk about confidence but I said clarity is more important. Clarity means, by closing our eyes we exactly know what our path is and then in that case we don't need confidence so we need to pay more attention how we exactly know what is to be done in a situation and the fourth thing is that as our vision is three billion dollars we need to look in to various aspects of filtration because filtration science is a eighty billion dollar industry so unless we make filtration as our passion we won't be able to reach to that.
					</p>

					<p>
						I have decided that in 2015, I would like to take each of these key value and talk to you say every quarter and communicate to all of you that we are making progress.
					</p>

					<p>
						Thank you and happy new year to all!
					</p>
