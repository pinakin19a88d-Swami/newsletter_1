					<h6 class="maroonText"><span>Mr S.S Pandit shares</span> his ideas on the role of <br/><span>FLEET POST</span>, as a common news sharing platform</h6>

					<p>
						For the past year or two, Kisandas had been a very active farmer in the village. He would claim to have the best seeds in the lot and always offered it to the nearby farmers. "We all should grow the superior quality corn, so we all benefit from it, isn't it?" he would say. This year, just after he won the award in the state fair, he told the interviewer that he would right away offer his best quality seeds to anyone in the village who wants to grow the corn, free of cost!
					</p>

					<p>
						However, people started growing sceptical of his offers. After all they were all in this business for profit! Now, why would Kisandas offer his superior quality seeds to everyone if he had the same profit motif! Why would he want to be helpful to his own competitors!
