						<h3>The<br/>Selfish<br/>Altruist</h3>
						<p>
							Kisandas lived in a small village of Kakori, in Uttar Pradesh. Like everyone else in the village, he was a farmer and lived with his family in a small house. Kakori was a small village with 2000 odd households.
						</p>

						<p>
							Almost all the farmers grew corn in the village of Kakori, especially in the months of May-June as it is the peak period for the plantation of corn. Kisandas, like everyone else grew corn in his farm every year. Kisandas was acclaimed in all the surrounding areas as the quality of his crop was renowned to be the best. Every year, his crop commanded the best price in the Mandi and was the first to be sold. In addition, every year, Kisandas won the "Best quality corn" award for his crop from the ministry of agriculture in the annual competition held in the Annual post harvest fair. This had now become the tradition for over five years.
						</p>

						<p>
							This year, a rookie news reporter of a TV News channel came to cover the rural life and harvest festivities and when he became aware of Kisandas, he decided to feature an interview of the farmer in his news capsule.
						</p>

						<p>
							He repeatedly probed Kisandas about why his crop was superior compared to all other farmers in the area. He asked about his farming practices, pest control, fertiliser etc. but Kisandas' answers did not yield anything much. The farmer kept on saying that he just followed the regular good farming practices and regular weeding, watering etc. The reporter got a little creative and asked if Kisandas played music for his plants or sang to his crop to make them happy and thus they grew well!
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="para">
						<p>
							In his efforts at digging more and more juicy tidbits about the farmer he came across an extremely intriguing fact. Every year, the farmer used to give corn seeds to all his neighbouring farmers, FREE OF COST!
						</p>

						<p>
							The reporter was incredulous. This farmer had, inarguably, the best crop in the entire area. All the neighbouring farmers in his area were technically a competition (as all of them sell their produce in the same mandi) and here was this man helping his competition!
						</p>

						<p>
							Now, why would Kisandas offer his superior quality seeds to everyone if he had the same profit motif! Why would he want to be helpful to his own competitors!
						</p>

						<p>
							'Kisandas is definitely up to something!' thought the reporter. "Maybe he fools people by giving the seeds that he calls superior" He believed that there was some secret to his benevolence which Kisandas was not revealing! Maybe he feared retribution from his envious neighbours for his success and this his way of bribing them?
						</p>

						<p>
							When he asked Kisandas as to why he was giving the best quality seed in the market free cost to his neighbours, the farmer had a very simple answer....
						</p>

						<p>
							What according to you would be reason for Kisandas to do what he is doing? Does the title suggest anything? Think the TOC way!
